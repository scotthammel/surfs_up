# Surfs_up

### Overview:

- The purpose of this analysis is to look into temperature trends for the months of June and December. This will lead to the ultimate question if W. Avy's surf and ice cream shop can be sustainable year-round in Oahu, Hawaii.


### Results:

The max temperature in June is 85 degress and 83 degrees in December. The minimum in December is 56 degrees and in June it is 64 Degrees.

### Summary:

- The data analysis for both the months of June and December show that the weather in Oahu is sustainable year-round. I would reccommend W. Avy pursue his surf and ice cream shop.

- It is worth noting that the data was collected using "sqlite:///hawaii.sqlite" and previous steps were taken to determine the weather station that can determine the most accurate data.
